\subsection{Backstory}% 7.3 Backstory
Describe any important elements of your story that do not tie directly into the gameplay. Much of this might not actually make it into the game, but it might be good to have it for reference.

\subsection{Narrative devices}% 7.4 Narrative devices
Describe the various ways in which you plan to reveal the story. What are the devices you plan to use to tell the story?
