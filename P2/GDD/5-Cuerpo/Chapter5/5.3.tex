\section{Controls} % 5.3 Controls
Map out the game procedures and controls. Use visualizations like control tables
and flowcharts, along with descriptions.

\subsection{Interfaces} %     5.3.1 Interfaces
Create wireframes, as described on page 439, for every interface the artists
will need to create. Each wire-frame should include a description of how each
interface feature functions. Make sure you detail out the various states for
each interface.

\subsection{Rules} %     5.3.2 Rules
If you have created a prototype, describing the rules of your game will be much
easier. You will need to define all the game objects, concepts, their behaviors,
and how they relate to one another in this section.

\subsection{Scoring/winning conditions}%     5.3.3 Scoring/winning conditions
Describe the scoring system and win conditions. These might be different for
single player versus multiplayer or if you have several modes of competition.
